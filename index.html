	<h2>Odyssey of the Mind and Theater</h2>

	<p>Odyssey of the Mind is a program that promotes solving problems creatively. I have done this program for 5 years now.
	There are three different levels of competition, regionals,  states, and worlds. My team and I have been to worlds twice.
	The first time my team went we came in 5th place out of 52 teams around the world.
	Being a part of Odyssey of the Mind has taught me so much and is something I will always cherish it.
</p>
<p>
	I have been acting and performing ever since I can remember.
	I was alway in the Christmas plays that my church put on put until middle school where I joined the theater club.
	I have been in two different Peter Pan plays. The first one I was played the part of Wendy Darling, and the second one I was Mrs.Darling.
	I was also in the play The Crucible, where I was Mercy.
	After that I started to go to a school that didn’t have a theater club so I made one with the help of some friends and became the president of it.
	Being a part of theater has helped me a lot with public speaking and leadership skills.

	<h2>Art Journey </h2>
	<p>I have been drawing and making art ever since I was a little kid. I started to take art seriously in seventh grade.
I love to experiment with my style by parts of my are more detailed  then other parts.
 My favorite median is water color, but I do enjoy making an acrylic piece every once in a while. I would describe my art style as cartoony.
Something that I do in my art is add a lot of flowers around a character. This is something that I am very fond of doing.
I also like to have patterned clothes. With an art style as simple as mine adding detail in clothes is something that makes the viewer look at.
Here is some of my art that I have done.
